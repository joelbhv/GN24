* Diseases
Diseases can harm you, you must craft something to get healed. See /diseases help.
The more you get a disease, the more immune you will be to it. This means that you have a lower chance of getting it next time.
Different infections need different medicines to cure.
You can also visit the doctor at the hospital to get healed from anything for a fee.
